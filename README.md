# Reliable Linked Web Forms

## About the project 
 This is my Master Thesis Github repository where I will leave a copy of the most important documents.
 
 I will be conducting a case-study on web-forms and how to improve them using LOD concepts.

The prototype on development is based on Python, Flask and rdflib and uses the RLWF ontology, which is available on the "onto" folder.

A snapshot of the google forms surveys used as an example are available on "surveys" folder.

### /app notes

This python app requires some pip installs that will be available on requirements.txt.
I also reccomend having a Virtual Enviroment to avoid a lot of clutter  on your python installation.
